# 19IT115-Disease-Predicition-using-Machine-Learning

# Project Overview
In this epidemic time, many individuals avoid to visit hospital. In that case, implementation of such project would be convenient. This project is about ‘Disease Prediction using ML’. Conditions such as Diabetes, Breast Cancer and Covid-19 could be predicted using this project. Importing data or symptoms is the only requirement of the project. This project would lighten the workload even of hospitals.

The ‘Disease Prediction’ project will predict the disease based on information or data provided. It can be derived that the patient has a particular disease or not, on the basis of data provided. This project doesn’t require any knowledge related to medical context.

# Problem and Solution Statement
This project would predict the disease by using patient’s symptoms and general information using dataset. This would provide 80% accurate result by comparing dataset of patient
to previously collected database. Firstly, collected data is prepared into dataset. Then rest of the work could be done by machine learning algorithm such as Decision tree, Random
Forest, etc. User doesn’t need to wait or visit the doctor unlike traditional methods. Even hospitals can use this for fast and almost accurate result.
