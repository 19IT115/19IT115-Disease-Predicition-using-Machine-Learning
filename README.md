# 19IT115-Disease-Predicition-using-Machine-Learning

# Project Overview
In this epidemic time, many individuals avoid to visit hospital. In that case, implementation of such project would be convenient. This project is about ‘Disease Prediction using ML’. Conditions such as Diabetes, Breast Cancer and Covid-19 could be predicted using this project. Importing data or symptoms is the only requirement of the project. This project would lighten the workload even of hospitals.

The ‘Disease Prediction’ project will predict the disease based on information or data provided. It can be derived that the patient has a particular disease or not, on the basis of data provided. This project doesn’t require any knowledge related to medical context.
